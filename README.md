# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It supports two players and offers a basic game board with rules, a winner announcement feature, and a reset button to restart the game.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The game adjusts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Two Player Mode**: Two users can take turns to play by marking cells on the grid.
- **Winner Detection**: Automatically detects when a player wins or the game results in a tie.
- **Game Reset**: The "Reset" button allows players to start a new game at any time.
- **Rules Display**: The game rules are displayed on the left side of the screen to guide players on how to play.

## Game Rules

- Players take turns marking one of the 3x3 cells.
- The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- If all the cells are marked and no player has aligned three marks, the game is a draw.
- Use the "Reset" button to start a new game.
